3016. Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II
You are given a string word containing lowercase English letters.
Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key 2 is mapped with ["a","b","c"], we need to push the key one time to type "a", two times to type "b", and three times to type "c" .
It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one key. You need to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string word.
Return the minimum number of pushes needed to type word after remapping the keys.
An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that 1, *, #, and 0 do not map to any letters.

Solution : We need to map a set of letters to any key and each key between 2 to 9 should have atleast one letter mapped 
and all letters should be mapped with one and only key. So we can atmost map 3 letters to 6 key and 4 letters to 2 key
but in any order. So for minimum pushes, we need most occuring key at first character of each key followed ny next most and till
least occuring charatcer. The push increase after using 8 key for each number of push , initially the push will be 1 and key will be 0
for every new character key increases for every 8 key push increases.
