Problem : 2134. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II

Problem Description : A swap is defined as taking two distinct positions in an array and swapping the values in them.
A circular array is defined as an array where we consider the first element and the last element to be adjacent.
Given a binary circular array nums, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's present in the array together at any location.

Idea : As the problem demands for clubbing all ones together, we need to first think of how many ones we can club together. 
The total number of ones we can club togrther is total number of ones present in the given array. Now taking that as size of 
a fixed window move through each window and check number of ones and number of zeroes.The window with minimum number of zeroes 
is the answer for swaps.
