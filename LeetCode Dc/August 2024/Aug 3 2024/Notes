1460. Make Two Arrays Equal by Reversing Subarrays

Problem Statement: You are given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr. In one step, you can select any non-empty subarray of arr and reverse it. 
You are allowed to make any number of steps.Return true if you can make arr equal to target or false otherwise.

Idea: As the problem says any number of subarrays of any length at worst case of arrangement we can even select individual elements at any number of reversals
we can get into target array if we have all the elements of target in given array. So the primary goal is to check if both array contains same elements
use a array hashmap to check.
